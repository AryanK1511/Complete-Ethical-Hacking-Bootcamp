# What is Ethical Hacking?

An ethical hacker, also known as a 'white hat hacker', is employed to legally break into computers and networks to test an organization's overall security. Ethical hackers possess all the skills of a cyber criminal but use their knowledge to improve organizations rather than exploit and damage them.
